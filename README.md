# AWS CDK

There is just one stack which does the followings:

1. Create a bucket
2. Upload static content into that bucket and enable hosting by specifying index document = `index.html`

Once `cdk bootstrap` and `cdk deploy` are successful, we will have the static content hosted on AWS S3 with `index.html`'s Object URL as our domain.
